Simple Search Suggestion
This project is a simple full-stack search suggestion application that is designed to help you understand how to build a search suggestion feature using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. It is built to demonstrate the basic skills of a full-stack developer and is not intended to be a comprehensive or fully-featured application.

The project uses an API endpoint to return search suggestions based on user input. As the user types, the application sends an AJAX request to a Node.js server, which makes a request to the API endpoint, receives the response, and filters it based on the user input. The filtered results are then displayed in the UI.
